# Feasibility Analysis

## Technical Feasibility

The technical feasibility analysis evaluates whether the proposed system can be implemented using existing technologies and within the constraints of the public-sector environment.

### Data Collection

From a technical perspective, the collection and management of data related to urban green areas are feasible:

- Environmental data can be obtained from existing sources such as environmental sensors, public datasets, satellite imagery, and historical maintenance records.
- Citizen-generated data can be collected through web or mobile interfaces.
- Relational or hybrid databases can be used to store structured information about green areas, reports, and interventions.

### AI-based Analysis

The use of AI techniques for monitoring and prediction is technically feasible:

- Machine learning models can be employed to detect anomalies, trends, or risks based on historical and real-time data.
- Predictive models can support early detection of degradation or maintenance needs.
- The system does not require fully autonomous decision-making; AI outputs are used as decision-support tools for human administrators.

### Core Management System

The core system responsible for data integration, analysis, and interaction with stakeholders is technically feasible:

- Standard web-based architectures can support dashboards, reporting tools, and administrative interfaces.
- Modular design allows separation between data management, AI analysis, and user interaction components.
- The system can be deployed incrementally, starting with basic monitoring features and gradually introducing advanced AI functionalities.

### User Accessibility

The development of user interfaces for citizens and administrators is feasible using standard technologies:

- Web-based interfaces ensure accessibility without requiring specialized hardware.
- Mobile-friendly designs support citizen participation and reporting.
- Accessibility guidelines can be applied to ensure inclusiveness.

### Security and Privacy Considerations

From a technical standpoint, security and privacy requirements can be addressed using existing solutions:

- Authentication and authorization mechanisms can restrict access to sensitive functionalities.
- Data protection measures can be implemented to comply with relevant regulations.

### Risk Analysis

Potential risks include:

- **Data Quality Issues:** Inaccurate or incomplete data could affect AI outputs.
- **Resistance to Adoption:** Stakeholders may be reluctant to trust AI-based recommendations.

## Economic Feasibility

The economic feasibility analysis evaluates costs, benefits, and overall sustainability of the proposed system.

### Costs

The main cost categories include:

- **Development Costs:** Costs related to software development, data integration, and AI model training.
- **Infrastructure Costs:** Expenses for servers, cloud services, or data storage.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Ongoing costs for system updates, model retraining, and technical support.
- **Training Costs:** Training public administration staff to use and interpret system outputs.

### Economic Assumptions

These values represent total company costs, not net salaries, based on average daily company costs in the Italian market:

- **Senior Project Manager:** 500 € / day
- **Senior MLOps Engineer:** 700 € / day
- **Junior Software Engineer:** 300 € / day

The project is designed to involve resources for a duration of 165 working days (8 months, 33 weeks). Developers should work full-time with a workload of 5 days a week, while management roles are part-time, with a workload of 2 days a week (40%):

- **1 Senior Project Manager:** 500 $\times$ 165 $\times$ 0,4 = 33.000 €
- **1 Senior MLOps Engineer:** 700 $\times$ 165 = 115.500 €
- **1 Junior Software Engineer:** 300 $\times$ 165 = 49.500 €

Other costs was distributed in a timeline of 5 years, this horizon was set to be the payback period for the investment.

### Benefits

The system provides several tangible and intangible benefits:

- **Cost Reduction:** Reduced emergency maintenance interventions, and lower repair costs due to preventive actions.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced administrative workload, and better allocation of maintenance staff.
- **Avoided Long-term Degradation:** Increased lifespan of green infrastructure, and reduced replacement costs.

### Benefits Summary Table

| **Description**                            | **Estimated Benefit (€)**  |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Cost Reduction                             | 50.000                     |

| **Total Benefit Estimation (Every Year)**  | **175.000**                |

### Return on Investment (ROI)

The ROI is not immediate but accumulates in a 5-year period:

- **Total Costs:** 418.000 €
- **Total Benefits:** 175.000 $\times$ 5 = 875.000 €
- **Net Benefit:** 875.000 − 418.000 = 457.000 €
- **Final Estimation:**

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Net Benefit}}{\text{Total Costs}} \times 100
$$

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{457.000}{418.000} \times 100 \approx 109\%
$$

Interpretation:

- The system reaches break-even between the 4th and 5th year.
- After 5 years, the investment yields a positive ROI of approximately 115%.
- Long-term benefits are expected to further increase as the system matures and scales.
