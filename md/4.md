# Feasibility Analysis

This chapter analyzes the feasibility of the AI-based Urban Green Areas Management System.
The analysis focuses on both **technical feasibility** and **economic feasibility**, evaluating whether the proposed solution can realistically be implemented and sustained within the context of a local public administration.

## 4.1 Technical Feasibility

The technical feasibility analysis evaluates whether the proposed system can be implemented using existing technologies and within the constraints of the public-sector environment.

### 4.1.1 Data Collection and Management

From a technical perspective, the collection and management of data related to urban green areas are feasible.

* Environmental data can be obtained from existing sources such as environmental sensors, public datasets, satellite imagery, and historical maintenance records.
* Citizen-generated data can be collected through web or mobile interfaces.
* Relational or hybrid databases can be used to store structured information about green areas, reports, and interventions.

The integration of heterogeneous data sources represents a challenge but is feasible using well-established data integration techniques.

### 4.1.2 AI-based Analysis

The use of AI techniques for monitoring and prediction is technically feasible.

* Machine learning models can be employed to detect anomalies, trends, or risks based on historical and real-time data.
* Predictive models can support early detection of degradation or maintenance needs.
* The system does not require fully autonomous decision-making; AI outputs are used as decision-support tools for human administrators.

Given the availability of mature AI frameworks and libraries, the development of such analytical components is considered feasible within the project scope.

### 4.1.3 Core Management System

The core system responsible for data integration, analysis, and interaction with stakeholders is technically feasible.

* Standard web-based architectures can support dashboards, reporting tools, and administrative interfaces.
* Modular design allows separation between data management, AI analysis, and user interaction components.
* The system can be deployed incrementally, starting with basic monitoring features and gradually introducing advanced AI functionalities.

### 4.1.4 User Interfaces and Accessibility

The development of user interfaces for citizens and administrators is feasible using standard technologies.

* Web-based interfaces ensure accessibility without requiring specialized hardware.
* Mobile-friendly designs support citizen participation and reporting.
* Accessibility guidelines can be applied to ensure inclusiveness.

### 4.1.5 Security and Privacy Considerations

From a technical standpoint, security and privacy requirements can be addressed using existing solutions.

* Authentication and authorization mechanisms can restrict access to sensitive functionalities.
* Data protection measures can be implemented to comply with relevant regulations.
* AI transparency and explainability mechanisms can be incorporated to improve trust in system outputs.

## 4.2 Economic Feasibility

The economic feasibility analysis evaluates costs, benefits, and overall sustainability of the proposed system.

### 4.2.1 Costs

The main cost categories include:

* **Development Costs**
  Costs related to software development, data integration, and AI model training.

* **Infrastructure Costs**
  Expenses for servers, cloud services, or data storage.

* **Maintenance Costs**
  Ongoing costs for system updates, model retraining, and technical support.

* **Training Costs**
  Training public administration staff to use and interpret system outputs.

### 4.2.2 Benefits

The system provides several tangible and intangible benefits:

* **Operational Efficiency**
  Improved planning and prioritization of maintenance interventions reduce waste of resources.

* **Cost Reduction**
  Preventive maintenance reduces long-term repair costs.

* **Improved Service Quality**
  Citizens benefit from better-maintained and safer green areas.

* **Data-Driven Decision-Making**
  Administrations gain stronger justification for decisions and investments.

### 4.2.3 Value for Public Administration

Although the system does not directly generate revenue, it creates value by:

* Reducing inefficiencies and administrative workload;
* Improving transparency and accountability;
* Supporting environmental sustainability goals.

These benefits justify the investment from a public-sector perspective.

### 4.2.4 Return on Investment (ROI)

The return on investment is not immediate but accumulates over time.

* Short-term ROI is achieved through improved coordination and reduced emergency interventions.
* Long-term ROI derives from lower maintenance costs, increased lifespan of green infrastructure, and improved quality of life.

### 4.2.5 Risk Analysis

Potential risks include:

* **Data Quality Issues**
  Inaccurate or incomplete data could affect AI outputs.

* **Resistance to Adoption**
  Stakeholders may be reluctant to trust AI-based recommendations.

* **Budget Constraints**
  Limited funding could restrict full system deployment.

These risks can be mitigated through phased deployment, stakeholder involvement, and continuous monitoring.

## 4.3 Summary

The feasibility analysis shows that the AI-based Urban Green Areas Management System is both **technically and economically feasible** within the context of a local public administration.
While some challenges exist, they are manageable through incremental development, appropriate governance, and careful stakeholder engagement.
