# Problem Frames

This chapter describes the problem and solution domains of the AI-based Urban Green Areas Management System using **Problem Frames**.
The objective is to clarify the interaction between the system-to-be and its environment, identifying the involved domains and justifying the correctness of the proposed solutions with respect to the previously defined requirements.

UML diagrams are used as a modeling language to represent the context, problem diagrams, and dynamic behavior of the system.

## 3.1 Context Diagram

The context of the system includes multiple interacting domains:

* **Citizens**, who interact with the system to access information and report issues.
* **Local Administration**, responsible for decision-making and coordination.
* **Environmental Experts and Maintenance Staff**, who rely on system outputs to plan and execute interventions.
* **Urban Environment**, representing the physical green areas being monitored.
* **External Data Sources**, such as environmental sensors or datasets.
* **AI-based Urban Green Areas Management System**, which acts as the machine domain.

The system acts as an intermediary between human stakeholders and the urban environment, collecting data, processing it, and supporting informed decision-making.

## 3.2 Problem Diagram

The main problem addressed by the system is the **inefficient and fragmented management of urban green areas**.

* The **Urban Environment** evolves independently and may degrade over time.
* The **Local Administration** needs reliable and timely information to intervene.
* **Citizens** observe issues but lack structured communication channels.
* The **System** observes data from the environment and stakeholders, processes it, and provides actionable information.

The shared phenomena include:

* Reports submitted by citizens;
* Environmental data collected from sensors or datasets;
* Maintenance decisions issued by the administration;
* Notifications and feedback provided by the system.

## 3.3 Citizen Interaction Problem Frame

### Description

This problem frame focuses on the interaction between **Citizens** and the **System**.

Citizens want to:

* Access information about the condition of urban green areas;
* Report issues related to safety or maintenance;
* Receive feedback about reported problems.

### Domains

* **Citizen** (biddable domain)
* **Management System** (machine domain)

### Correctness Argument

The solution is correct if:

* Citizens can successfully submit reports through the system;
* Submitted reports are correctly recorded and associated with the corresponding green area;
* Citizens can access updated information and receive feedback on the status of interventions.

## 3.4 Local Administration Problem Frame

### Description

This problem frame addresses the needs of the **Local Administration**, which must plan and prioritize maintenance activities.

### Domains

* **Local Administration** (biddable domain)
* **Management System** (machine domain)
* **Urban Environment** (given domain)

### Correctness Argument

The system is correct if:

* Administrators can access a comprehensive overview of urban green areas;
* The system supports prioritization of interventions based on data and identified risks;
* Decisions taken using the system are traceable and justifiable.

## 3.5 Environmental Data Management Problem Frame

### Description

This frame focuses on the collection and management of environmental data.

### Domains

* **External Data Sources** (given domain)
* **Urban Environment** (given domain)
* **Management System** (machine domain)

### Correctness Argument

The solution is correct if:

* Environmental data are correctly collected and stored;
* Data accurately represent the condition of green areas;
* Data are made available to other system components in a reliable manner.

## 3.6 AI Analysis Problem Frame

### Description

This problem frame captures the role of AI-based analysis within the system.

### Domains

* **Management System** (machine domain)
* **Environmental Data Repository** (given domain)

### Correctness Argument

The AI component is correct if:

* It analyzes available data to identify anomalies and potential risks;
* Predictions and insights are consistent with observed data;
* The system presents AI outputs in a way understandable by human decision-makers.

## 3.7 Notification and Feedback Problem Frame

### Description

This frame describes how the system communicates outcomes and updates to stakeholders.

### Domains

* **Management System** (machine domain)
* **Citizens** (biddable domain)
* **Local Administration** (biddable domain)

### Correctness Argument

The notification mechanism is correct if:

* Stakeholders receive timely updates regarding reported issues and interventions;
* Notifications cease when no longer relevant;
* Information provided is accurate and consistent with system data.

## 3.8 UML Behavioral Diagrams

To support the problem frames analysis, behavioral UML diagrams are considered.

* **Activity Diagram**
  Describes the workflow from issue detection (via data or citizen report) to decision-making and intervention.

* **State Diagram**
  Models the lifecycle of a reported issue (e.g., *reported*, *validated*, *scheduled*, *resolved*).

These diagrams help clarify the temporal ordering of interactions between domains and ensure consistency with system requirements.

## 3.9 Summary

The Problem Frames analysis decomposes the overall problem into manageable sub-problems, each focusing on a specific interaction between the system and its environment.
The provided correctness arguments justify that, if the specified conditions are met, the system satisfies the goals and requirements identified in the Goal-Oriented Analysis.

This chapter provides a solid foundation for evaluating the **feasibility** of the proposed system, which will be addressed in the next chapter.
