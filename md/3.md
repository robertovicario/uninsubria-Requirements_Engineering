# Problem Frames

## Context

The context of the system includes multiple interacting domains:

- **Citizens:** Who interact with the system to access information and report issues.
- **Local Administration:** Responsible for decision-making and coordination.
- **Environmental Experts and Maintenance Staff:** Who rely on system outputs to plan and execute interventions.
- **Urban Environment:** Representing the physical green areas being monitored.
- **External Data Sources:** Such as environmental sensors or datasets.
- **AI-based Urban Green Areas Management System:** Which acts as the machine.

## Problem Frame

The main problem addressed by the system is the inefficient and fragmented management of urban green areas:

- The _Urban Environment_ evolves independently and may degrade over time.
- _Citizens_ observe issues but lack structured communication channels.
- The _Local Administration_ needs reliable and timely information to intervene.
- The system observes data from the environment and stakeholders, processes it, and provides actionable information.

The shared phenomena include:

- Reports submitted by citizens.
- Environmental data collected from sensors or datasets.
- Maintenance decisions issued by the administration.
- Notifications and feedback provided by the system.

### Citizen Problem Frame

This problem frame focuses on the interaction between _Citizens_ and the system. Citizens want to:

- Access information about the condition of urban green areas;
- Report issues related to safety or maintenance;
- Receive feedback about reported problems.

> **Domains:**
>
> - _Management System_ (machine)
> - _Citizen_ (biddable)

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Correctness Argument:**

- _Citizens_ can successfully submit reports through the system.
- Submitted reports are correctly recorded and associated with the corresponding green area.
- _Citizens_ can access updated information and receive feedback on the status of interventions.

### Local Administration Problem Frame

This problem frame addresses the needs of the _Local Administration_, which must plan and prioritize maintenance activities.

\vspace{0.5cm}

> **Domains:**
>
> - _Management System_ (machine)
> - _Urban Environment_ (given)
> - _Local Administration_ (biddable)

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Correctness Argument:**

- _Administrators_ can access a comprehensive overview of urban green areas.
- The system supports prioritization of interventions based on data and identified risks.
- Decisions taken using the system are traceable and justifiable.

## Environmental Data Management Problem Frame

This frame focuses on the collection, storage, and management of environmental data related to urban green areas.

\vspace{0.5cm}

> **Domains:**
>
> - _Management System_ (machine)
> - _Urban Environment_ (given)
> - _External Data Sources_ (given)

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Correctness Argument:**

- Environmental data are accurately collected from various sources.
- Data accurately reflect the state of the _Urban Environment_.
- Data are made available to other system components in a reliable manner.

### AI Analysis Problem Frame

This problem frame describes the AI-based analysis of collected data to generate insights for decision-making.

\vspace{0.5cm}

> **Domains:**
>
> - _Management System_ (machine)
> - _Environmental Data_ (given)

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Correctness Argument:**

- It analyzes available data to identify anomalies and potential risks.
- Predictions and insights are consistent with observed data.
- The system presents AI outputs in a way understandable by human decision-makers.

## Notification and Feedback Problem Frame

This frame addresses the notification mechanism to inform stakeholders about reported issues and planned interventions.

\vspace{0.5cm}

> **Domains:**
>
> - _Management System_ (machine)
> - _Citizens_ (biddable)
> - _Local Administration_ (biddable)

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Correctness Argument:**

- Stakeholders receive timely updates regarding reported issues and interventions.
- Notifications cease when no longer relevant.
- Information provided is accurate and consistent with system data.
