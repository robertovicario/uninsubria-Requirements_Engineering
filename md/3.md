# Problem Frames

## Context Diagram

The context of the system includes multiple interacting domains:

- **Citizens:** Who interact with the system to access information and report issues.
- **Local Administration:** Responsible for decision-making and coordination.
- **Environmental Experts and Maintenance Staff:** Who rely on system outputs to plan and execute interventions.
- **Urban Environment:** Representing the physical green areas being monitored.
- **External Data Sources:** Such as environmental sensors or datasets.
- **AI-based Urban Green Areas Management System:** Which acts as the machine domain.

## Problem Diagram

The main problem addressed by the system is the inefficient and fragmented management of urban green areas:

- The _Urban Environment_ evolves independently and may degrade over time.
- The _Local Administration_ needs reliable and timely information to intervene.
- _Citizens_ observe issues but lack structured communication channels.
- The _System_ observes data from the environment and stakeholders, processes it, and provides actionable information.

The shared phenomena include:

- Reports submitted by citizens.
- Environmental data collected from sensors or datasets.
- Maintenance decisions issued by the administration.
- Notifications and feedback provided by the system.

## Citizen Problem Frame

This problem frame focuses on the interaction between _Citizens_ and the _System_. Citizens want to:

- Access information about the condition of urban green areas;
- Report issues related to safety or maintenance;
- Receive feedback about reported problems.

> **Domains**
>
> - _Citizen_ (biddable domain)
> - _Management System_ (machine domain)

> **Correctness Argument**
>
> - _Citizens_ can successfully submit reports through the system.
> - Submitted _Reports_ are correctly recorded and associated with the corresponding green area.
> - _Citizens_ can access updated information and receive feedback on the status of interventions.

## Local Administration Problem Frame

This problem frame addresses the needs of the _Local Administration_, which must plan and prioritize maintenance activities.

> **Domains**
>
> - _Local Administration_ (biddable domain)
> - _Management System_ (machine domain)
> - _Urban Environment_ (given domain)

> **Correctness Argument**
>
> - _Administrators_ can access a comprehensive overview of urban green areas.
> - The _System_ supports prioritization of interventions based on data and identified risks.
> - Decisions taken using the _System_ are traceable and justifiable.

## Environmental Data Management Problem Frame

This frame focuses on the collection, storage, and management of environmental data related to urban green areas.

> **Domains**
>
> - _External Data Sources_ (given domain)
> - _Urban Environment_ (given domain)
> - _Management System_ (machine domain)

> **Correctness Argument**
>
> - _Environmental Data_ are accurately collected from various sources.
> - Data accurately reflect the state of the _Urban Environment_.
> - Data are made _Available_ to other system components in a _Reliable_ manner.

## AI Analysis Problem Frame

This problem frame describes the AI-based analysis of collected data to generate insights for decision-making.

> **Domains**
>
> - _Management System_ (machine domain)
> - _Environmental Data Repository_ (given domain)

> **Correctness Argument**
>
> - It analyzes _Available Data_ to identify anomalies and potential risks.
> - _Predictions and Insights_ are consistent with observed data.
> - The system presents AI outputs in a way understandable by _Human Decision-Makers_.

## Notification and Feedback Problem Frame

This frame addresses the notification mechanism to inform stakeholders about reported issues and planned interventions.

> **Domains**
>
> - _Management System_ (machine domain)
> - _Citizens_ (biddable domain)
> - _Local Administration_ (biddable domain)

> **Correctness Argument**
>
> - _Stakeholders_ receive timely updates regarding reported issues and interventions.
> - _Notifications_ cease when no longer relevant.
> - _Information_ provided is accurate and consistent with system data.
