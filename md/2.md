# Goal-Oriented Analysis

## Requirements Elicitation

This section presents the requirements elicitation phase for the AI-based Urban Green Areas Management System.

The elicitation process has been conducted by identifying the main stakeholders involved in the context of urban green area management and by analyzing their needs, expectations, and constraints.

The requirements are grouped according to stakeholder categories, following an approach similar to the one adopted in the Fine Management System project, distinguishing between user requirements, administrative requirements, system requirements, and non-functional requirements.

### Citizens' Requirements

Citizens represent one of the primary stakeholders, as they are the main beneficiaries of well-maintained urban green areas. Their requirements include:

- **Access to Information:** Citizens should be able to access clear and updated information about the condition of public green areas, including ongoing or planned maintenance activities.
- **Issue Reporting:** Citizens should be able to report problems related to urban green areas (e.g., damaged trees, lack of maintenance, safety issues) through a simple and accessible interface.
- **Feedback and Transparency:** Citizens should receive feedback about the status of their reports and be informed when an intervention is planned or completed.
- **Usability and Accessibility:** The system should be easy to use and accessible to citizens with different levels of digital literacy.

### Local Administration Requirements

Local administrations are responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing maintenance activities for urban green areas. Their requirements include:

- **Centralized Monitoring:** Administrations should be able to monitor all urban green areas through a centralized dashboard.
- **Prioritization of Interventions:** Administrations should be supported in prioritizing maintenance actions based on urgency, environmental impact, and available resources.
- **Decision Support:** The system should provide decision-support functionalities to assist administrators in planning short-term and long-term maintenance strategies.
- **Accountability and Reporting:** Administrations should be able to generate reports to justify decisions and resource allocation to policymakers and funding bodies.

### Environmental Experts Requirements

Environmental experts and technicians are responsible for assessing the health of green areas and executing maintenance activities. Their requirements include:

- **Accurate Environmental Data:** Experts should have access to reliable data regarding vegetation health, soil conditions, and environmental stress factors.
- **Predictive Insights:** The system should support experts by identifying early signs of degradation, diseases, or other risks affecting green areas.
- **Operational Support:** Maintenance staff should be supported in scheduling and coordinating interventions efficiently.

### System Requirements

From a system perspective, the following requirements emerge:

- **Data Integration:** The system should integrate heterogeneous data sources, including sensor data, external datasets, historical maintenance records, and citizen reports.
- **AI-based Analysis:** The system should employ AI techniques to analyze collected data and generate insights useful for monitoring and prediction.
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to support different city sizes and increasing volumes of data.
- **Interoperability:** The system should be able to interoperate with existing information systems used by public administrations.

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **Security and Privacy**
  Sensitive data, especially citizen-related data, should be protected according to applicable data protection regulations.

* **Reliability**
  The system should provide accurate and reliable information to avoid incorrect or misleading decisions.

* **Transparency and Explainability**
  AI-generated insights should be understandable by human decision-makers to support trust and accountability.

## Goal Modeling Overview

The goal-oriented analysis is conducted using the **KAOS approach**, which allows modeling stakeholder intentions and systematically refining them into requirements. At a high level, the system aims to support the _Sustainable and Effective Management of Urban Green Areas_.

## Abstract Goals

The following high-level strategic goals have been identified:

1. **(G1) Improve Urban Green Areas Quality:** Urban green areas should be maintained in a healthy, safe, and accessible condition.
2. **(G2) Support Sustainable Urban Development:** Green areas should contribute to environmental sustainability and citizens' well-being.
3. **(G3) Improve Decision-Making in Public Administration:** Local administrations should make informed and timely decisions regarding maintenance and planning.

These goals are strategic and organization-wide, reflecting long-term objectives rather than specific system functionalities.

## Goal Refinements

### Refinement of G1: Improve Urban Green Areas Quality

G1 can be refined into the following sub-goals:

1. **(G1.1) Monitor the Condition of Urban Green Areas:** The condition of green areas should be continuously monitored.
2. **(G1.2) Detect Degradation and Risks Early:** Potential issues should be identified before they lead to serious degradation.
3. **(G1.3) Ensure Timely Maintenance Interventions:** Maintenance actions should be planned and executed in a timely manner.

### Refinement of G2: Support Sustainable Urban Development

1. **(G2.1) Reduce Environmental Impact:** Maintenance strategies should minimize negative environmental effects.
2. **(G2.2) Increase Citizens' Quality of Life:** Green areas should promote social interaction, safety, and well-being.

### Refinement of G3: Improve Decision-Making in Public Administration

1. **(G3.1) Provide Data-Driven Insights:** Decisions should be supported by data analysis rather than intuition alone.
2. **(G3.2) Optimize Resource Allocation:** Financial and human resources should be used efficiently.

## Operational Goals and Requirements

Some refined goals are assigned to the software system and thus become requirements. For example:

1. **(R1) Provide a Monitoring Dashboard:** The system shall provide a dashboard displaying the condition of urban green areas.
2. **(R2) Analyze Data Using AI Techniques:** The system shall analyze integrated data to detect anomalies and predict risks.
3. **(R3) Support Intervention Prioritization:** The system shall support the prioritization of maintenance interventions.
4. **(R4) Enable Citizen Reporting:** The system shall allow citizens to submit reports regarding green area issues.

## Conflicts and Trade-offs

Several potential conflicts emerge during goal analysis:

- **Transparency vs. Privacy:** Providing detailed information to citizens may conflict with privacy requirements.
- **Automation vs. Human Control:** AI-based recommendations must not fully replace human judgment in decision-making.

These conflicts require careful trade-offs, favoring transparency and automation while preserving privacy and human oversight.

## Summary

The goal-oriented analysis clarifies _Why_ the system is needed and _Which_ objectives it must satisfy before defining specific technical solutions.

By refining high-level goals into operational requirements, this analysis provides a structured rationale for the system design and prepares the ground for the _Problem Frames Analysis_, which will further detail the interaction between the system and its environment.
