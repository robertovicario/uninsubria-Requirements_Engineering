# Goal-Oriented Analysis

## Requirements Elicitation

The elicitation process has been conducted by identifying the main stakeholders involved in the context of urban green area management and by analyzing their needs, expectations, and constraints.

### Citizens' Requirements

Their requirements include:

- **Access to Information:** Citizens should be able to access clear and updated information about the condition of public green areas, including ongoing or planned maintenance activities.
- **Issue Reporting:** Citizens should be able to report problems related to urban green areas through a simple and accessible interface.
- **Feedback and Transparency:** Citizens should receive feedback about the status of their reports and be informed when an intervention is planned or completed.
- **Usability and Accessibility:** The system should be easy to use and accessible to citizens with different levels of digital literacy.

### Local Administration Requirements

Their requirements include:

- **Centralized Monitoring:** Administrations should be able to monitor all urban green areas through a centralized dashboard.
- **Prioritization of Interventions:** Administrations should be supported in prioritizing maintenance actions based on urgency, environmental impact, and available resources.
- **Decision Support:** The system should provide decision-support functionalities to assist administrators in planning short-term and long-term maintenance strategies.
- **Accountability and Reporting:** Administrations should be able to generate reports to justify decisions and resource allocation to policymakers and funding bodies.

### Environmental Experts Requirements

Their requirements include:

- **Accurate Environmental Data:** Experts should have access to reliable data regarding vegetation health, soil conditions, and environmental stress factors.
- **Predictive Insights:** The system should support experts by identifying early signs of degradation, diseases, or other risks affecting green areas.
- **Operational Support:** Maintenance staff should be supported in scheduling and coordinating interventions efficiently.

### System Requirements

From a system perspective, the following requirements emerge:

- **Data Integration:** The system should integrate heterogeneous data sources, including sensor data, external datasets, historical maintenance records, and citizen reports.
- **AI-based Analysis:** The system should employ AI techniques to analyze collected data and generate insights useful for monitoring and prediction.
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to support different city sizes and increasing volumes of data.
- **Interoperability:** The system should be able to interoperate with existing information systems used by public administrations.

### Non-Functional Requirements

Several non-functional requirements have been identified:

- **Security and Privacy:** Sensitive data, especially citizen-related data, should be protected according to applicable data protection regulations.
- **Reliability:** The system should provide accurate and reliable information to avoid incorrect or misleading decisions.
- **Explainability:** AI-generated insights should be understandable by human decision-makers to support trust and accountability.

## Goal Modeling Overview

The goal-oriented analysis is conducted using the _KAOS Approach_, which allows modeling stakeholder intentions and systematically refining them into requirements.

## Abstract Goals

The following high-level strategic goals have been identified:

1. **(G1) Improve Urban Green Areas Quality:** Urban green areas should be maintained in a healthy, safe, and accessible condition.
2. **(G2) Support Sustainable Urban Development:** Green areas should contribute to environmental sustainability and citizens' well-being.
3. **(G3) Improve Decision-Making in Public Administration:** Local administrations should make informed and timely decisions regarding maintenance and planning.

## Goal Refinements

For each abstract goal, refinements have been made to break them down into more specific sub-goals.

### Refinement of G1: Improve Urban Green Areas Quality

G1 can be refined into the following sub-goals:

1. **(G1.1) Monitor the Condition of Urban Green Areas:** The condition of green areas should be continuously monitored.
2. **(G1.2) Detect Degradation and Risks Early:** Potential issues should be identified before they lead to serious degradation.
3. **(G1.3) Ensure Timely Maintenance Interventions:** Maintenance actions should be planned and executed in a timely manner.

### Refinement of G2: Support Sustainable Urban Development

G2 can be refined into the following sub-goals:

1. **(G2.1) Reduce Environmental Impact:** Maintenance strategies should minimize negative environmental effects.
2. **(G2.2) Increase Citizens' Quality of Life:** Green areas should promote social interaction, safety, and well-being.

### Refinement of G3: Improve Decision-Making in Public Administration

G3 can be refined into the following sub-goals:

1. **(G3.1) Provide Data-Driven Insights:** Decisions should be supported by data analysis rather than intuition alone.
2. **(G3.2) Optimize Resource Allocation:** Financial and human resources should be used efficiently.

### Requirements

Some refined goals are assigned to the software system and thus become requirements, such as:

1. **(R1) Provide a Monitoring Dashboard:** The system shall provide a dashboard displaying the condition of urban green areas.
2. **(R2) Analyze Data Using AI Techniques:** The system shall analyze integrated data to detect anomalies and predict risks.
3. **(R3) Support Intervention Prioritization:** The system shall support the prioritization of maintenance interventions.
4. **(R4) Enable Citizen Reporting:** The system shall allow citizens to submit reports regarding green area issues.

### Obstacles

Several potential obstacles emerge during goal analysis:

- **Transparency vs. Privacy:** Providing detailed information to citizens may conflict with privacy requirements.
- **Automation vs. Human Control:** AI-based recommendations must not fully replace human judgment in decision-making.
