# Informal Problem Description

## Context

Urban green areas such as parks, public gardens, tree-lined streets, and small urban forests play a crucial role in improving the quality of life of citizens. They contribute to reducing air and noise pollution, mitigating urban heat islands, supporting biodiversity, and providing spaces for social interaction and well-being.

Despite their importance, many municipalities struggle to manage and maintain these green areas effectively. Maintenance activities are often reactive rather than preventive, relying on manual inspections, citizen complaints, or sporadic interventions. As a result, green areas may become degraded, unsafe, or underutilized, while public administrations face increasing costs and limited resources.

## Stakeholders' Needs

The primary stakeholders involved in the management of urban green areas include:

- **Local Administration:** Municipalities need effective tools to monitor the condition of green areas, prioritize maintenance interventions, and allocate resources efficiently. They also need to justify decisions to citizens and policymakers, ensuring transparency and compliance with environmental regulations.
- **Citizens:** Citizens expect clean, safe, and accessible green spaces that enhance their quality of life. They want to be informed about the state of public spaces, to report issues easily, and to see timely responses from the administration.
- **Environmental Experts:** Botanists, environmental consultants, and maintenance staff need accurate and up-to-date data about vegetation health, soil conditions, and environmental stress factors to plan appropriate interventions.

## Problem Description

The current management of urban green areas is often fragmented and inefficient. Data related to vegetation health, maintenance history, environmental conditions, and citizen feedback are scattered across different systems or not collected at all. This leads to delayed interventions, higher long-term costs, and dissatisfaction among citizens.

Moreover, the lack of predictive capabilities prevents administrations from anticipating issues such as plant diseases, drought stress, or degradation of public spaces. Decisions are frequently based on limited information and subjective judgment rather than on comprehensive and continuously updated data.

## Why a Computer-Based System

A computer-based system enhanced with AI techniques represents a suitable solution to address these challenges. Such a system can integrate heterogeneous data sources, from environmental sensors to citizen reports, analyze them and provide actionable insights to decision-makers.

Artificial intelligence can support:

- _Continuous Monitoring_ of urban green areas.
- _Early Detection_ of potential problems.
- _Prioritization of Interventions_ based on risk, impact, and available resources.
- _Improved Communication_ between citizens and local administrations.
- _Data-Driven Decision-Making_ to optimize maintenance strategies and resource allocation.

## Expected Features of the System

The proposed system should include the following key features:

1. **Urban Green Areas Dashboard:** A centralized interface providing an overview of all green areas, including their location, condition, and maintenance status.
2. **Data Collection and Integration:** The system should collect and integrate data from multiple sources, such as environmental sensors, external datasets, and citizen reports.
3. **AI-based Analysis and Prediction:** AI models should analyze historical and real-time data to detect anomalies, predict future issues, and support maintenance planning.
4. **Citizen Interaction and Reporting:** Citizens should be able to report issues and receive feedback on planned or completed interventions.
5. **Decision Support for Administrations:** The system should support local administrations in prioritizing actions, estimating costs, and evaluating the impact of different strategies.

## Conclusion

The proposed system addresses a relevant and timely problem faced by many public administrations. By leveraging artificial intelligence within a well-defined public-sector context, the system aims to improve environmental sustainability, operational efficiency, and citizens' quality of life.
